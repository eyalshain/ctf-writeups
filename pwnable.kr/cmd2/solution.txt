./cmd2 "command -p cat *"
or
./cmd2 "command -p cat * | command -p tail -n 1"

in cmd2, path variable gets overridden so we can't use 'cat', but in addition to that we can't use '/', so we can't specify the full
path - /bin/cat. so I googled and found that about the command -p, which looks in a secure predefined path that does usually points
to the /bin directory, that way the cat command will work and of course we using the * cause we can't use flag, so we printing the 
whole directory.
