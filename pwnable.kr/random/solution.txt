random - pwnable.kr writeup


as we see in the c code, the program use rand() to generate a pseudorandom number, but since the program didn't use srand(), it uses the same seed value over and over again, so no matter how many times we run the program - the variable random
will always have the same value. with that being said, we can just create a file on pwnable.kr's machine to print rand()!!
now because we don't have permission, we will create a c file on the /tmp directory, where we do have permission...

vim /tmp/file.c

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {

        unsigned int bro = rand();
        printf("number = %d\n", bro);

        return 0;
}


gcc -o run file.c
./run

output:
number = 1804289383

now we can xor that number with the target (0xcafebabe) and get:
2708864985

let's run:

random@ubuntu:~$ ./random
2708864985
Good!
m0mmy_I_can_predict_rand0m_v4lue!
random@ubuntu:~$



and we got the flag!!! adiosss!
