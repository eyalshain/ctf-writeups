blackjack - pwnable.kr solution


flag: Woohoo_I_am_now_a_MILL10NAIRE!

a simeple way to do it is by loosing (which is not hard), cause when u lose the program does:

cash = cash - bet, so what happen if bet is negative? what is --? +! so we can enter a negative value like
-1000000, which then our cash will raised and we get the flag.
