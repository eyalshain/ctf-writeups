pwnable.kr - mistake

the vulneraility is in the first condition:
if(fd=open("/home/mistake/password",O_RDONLY,0400) < 0)

because it doesn't have parentheses, what it basically doing is assigning fd to open(..) < 0
and because the file is opened successfully, that condition is false, so fd = 0. with that being said, both read() happen from stdin.
now about xor() function, it goes through the s and to each character perform a bitwise xor operation. so our goal is this:
provide a certain input, and then another one but to each character of the first one we need to perform xor. so let's take:
1111111111, ord('1') = 49 ===> 49 ^ 1 = 48. chr(48) = '0'

so, the first input can be:
1111111111
and the second:
0000000000

run the program with those inputs and get the flag:


flag: Mommy_the_0perator_priority_confuses_me
